# Money Streaming Program

The **Money Streaming Program** is an implementation of the **[Money Streaming Protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19W5V2B8eyFIocccgSP4orn6Wi1El07LQSyaT7yw6hMQ)** built and deployed on the **Solana** blockchain, with address `7GsGvccB8LMbVhbhB1Zo8erVC82xDpoEgrm4EBbxBWcj` on [Devnet](https://explorer.solana.com/address/Ctpd8JratL29eZx2cHsR74DdbqytPCfAzbtSH66JHh3R?cluster=devnet).

The main two goals of the **Money Streaming Program** is to support the interaction of the **[Mean Pay Dapp](https://github.com/mean-code/mean-pay-webapp)** with the **Solana** blockchain and provide an API that can be used and leveraged by other apps and smart contracts to manage their own payment use cases.
