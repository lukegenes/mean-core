# Money Streaming Program

The **Money Streaming Program** is an implementation of the **[Money Streaming Protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19W5V2B8eyFIocccgSP4orn6Wi1El07LQSyaT7yw6hMQ)** built and deployed on the **Solana** blockchain, with address `H6wJxgkcc93yeUFnsZHgor3Q3pSWgGpEysfqKrwLtMko` on [Mainnet Beta](https://explorer.solana.com/address/H6wJxgkcc93yeUFnsZHgor3Q3pSWgGpEysfqKrwLtMko).

Money streaming represents the idea of continuous payments over time. Block numbers are used to measure time in the blockchain and continuously update the balances of the parties in the contract.
